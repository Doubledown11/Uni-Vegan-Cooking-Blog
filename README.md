# Uni-Vegan-Cooking-Blog
A short blog covering some recipes used during my time in university.

NOTE: This is unfinished.

Utilized Django (Python), JavaScript, HTML, CSS and bootstrap. 

Created a users app which allows for users registration, sign in, and sign out.

JavaScript was used to:
    give the site title a typewriter effect, 
    give the site a dark mode,
    and create a modal pop-up when trying to sign out.


Also used CSS media queries to ensure the site is responsive to various heights and widths.
